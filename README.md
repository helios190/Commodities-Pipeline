## üí° Proposed Solution

The solution integrates advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and data visualization to address challenges in commodity markets. Key components include:

1. **Data Sources**  
   - **Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS)**: Provides APIs for BI Rate, inflation, and other macroeconomic data.  
   - **Yahoo Finance**: Supplies exchange rate data (IDR-USD) and commodity price/volume data.  

2. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - **SARIMAX Model**: Forecasts commodity prices for the upcoming 12 months using seasonal and trend-based analysis.  
   - **K-Means Clustering**: Classifies commodities into low-risk and high-risk groups based on historical data.  

3. **Dashboard Infrastructure**  
   - **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores processed data for efficient retrieval.  
   - **Visualization (Tableau)**: Presents interactive dashboards with key insights on trends, risks, and macroeconomic factors.  
   - **Data Processing (PySpark)**: Handles large-scale data transformations and predictions efficiently.

## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. **ETL Process**
- **Airflow DAG**: Automates data scraping (commodity prices, BI Rate, inflation), transformation, and loading into the database.

### 2. **Predictive Modelling**
- **SARIMAX**: Used for forecasting commodity prices for 12 months.  
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups commodities into high-risk and low-risk categories.

### 3. **Transformation**
- Converts raw data into usable formats using PySpark and Python.  
- Maps Indonesian month names to English for compatibility.  
- Handles missing or inconsistent data by standardizing values.
